                  <h2>JEREMY ZUCKER</h2><br>
                  <p>When 24-year-old singer, songwriter, producer Jeremy Zucker wowed the world with his 2018 breakout single, “comethru,” he was in his home state of New Jersey in his childhood bedroom. In a contemplative space, Zucker would craft a song that would ultimately change his life, despite already landing a recording contract with Republic Records and selling over 500,000 singles the year prior. That was less than two years ago, and during that time Zucker would tour the world, release groundbreaking projects, and amass over 2.5 billion global streams. The recent release of his debut album ‘love is not dying', however, is his biggest to date and will continue Zucker’s upward trajectory.</p>

                <p>
                    In September 2018, Zucker released the EP "summer," which contains Zucker's well known song "comethru". "comethru" is a response to the way Zucker felt after graduating college in May 2018 and moving back home to New Jersey into the same house where Zucker grew up.[4] Also featured on the EP is “thinking 2 much”, a collaboration with singer Eden.
